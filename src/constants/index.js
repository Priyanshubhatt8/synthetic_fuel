The evaluation for TC Energy Corporation outlines detailed plans for implementing a synthetic fuel production system. TC Energy, primarily involved in natural gas and crude oil production, aims to expand by integrating synthetic fuels. Their goal is to produce a minimum of 100 million liters annually by Q3 2027, demonstrating a strategic commitment to innovation and growth.The assessment starts with the mapping of functionalities that TC Energy has in place; this covers current operations in natural gas and crude oil, as well as the processing and distribution of power. It spells out detailed specifications for the new synthetic fuel production system that shall include, without limitation, the use of high-temperature steam electrolysis, nuclear energy, the use of CO2 from biorefineries and the incorporation of the Fischer Tropsch process to synthesize liquid hydrocarbons from CO2 and hydrogenâ€”subsequently, the requisite infrastructure developments for the distribution networks, storage tanks, and pipelines.Three potential solutions are considered in detail, providing a balanced analysis of how to reach the overall objectives of producing synthetic fuel. The solutions can then be compared and evaluated according to specific factors that include cost, time for implementation, modularity or flexibility, feasibility level, resource demands, risks, management and provisions needed, influence on business procedures, and compliance with respective benchmarks in the field of technology economy. Thus, the specifics of the analysis aimed at offering TC Energy a clear and comprehensive overview of the options for substantial further development and keeping the strategic advantage in the context of the energy market",
